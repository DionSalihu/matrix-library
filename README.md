# Matrix Library

A high-performance, thread-optimized C++ matrix library supporting basic linear algebra operations with elements stored contiguously in row-major order.

## Design Choices

### Storage Strategy
- **Row-major storage**: Elements are stored contiguously in a `std::vector<double>` using row-major order for cache-friendly access patterns and compatibility with most linear algebra libraries.
- **Single vector approach**: All matrix data is stored in one contiguous block, enabling efficient memory access and simple indexing with formula `index = i * cols + j`.

### Thread Optimization
- **Automatic threading**: Operations automatically use multiple threads for matrices larger than 64x64 elements
- **Hardware-aware**: Thread count automatically adapts to available CPU cores (`std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`)
- **Optimized operations**: Matrix multiplication, addition, subtraction, and transpose operations are parallelized
- **Thread-safe**: Read operations are inherently thread-safe due to immutable result generation

### Constructor Design
- **Multiple constructors**: Default, dimension-based, value-based, and initializer-list constructors provide flexibility for different use cases.
- **Initializer-list support**: Enables intuitive syntax like `Matrix m = {{1,2},{3,4}}` with validation for equal row lengths.
- **Exception safety**: All constructors validate input and throw `std::invalid_argument` for invalid dimensions or mismatched row sizes.

### Rule of Zero Implementation
- **Compiler-generated special members**: Relies on automatically generated copy constructor, copy assignment, move constructor, move assignment, and destructor.
- **RAII compliance**: Uses `std::vector` for automatic memory management, eliminating need for custom resource management.

### Element Access
- **Bounds checking**: Uses `assert()` for debug-time bounds checking while maintaining release performance.
- **Dual access operators**: Provides both const and non-const versions of `operator()` for read and write access.

## Performance Optimizations

### Threading Strategy
- **Row-wise parallelization**: Matrix multiplication distributes rows across threads for optimal cache locality
- **Element-wise parallelization**: Addition/subtraction operations split elements across threads
- **Automatic threshold**: Threading is only used for matrices with 64+ elements to avoid overhead
- **Load balancing**: Work is distributed evenly across available threads

### Compiler Optimizations
- **Release mode**: Compiled with `-O3 -march=native` for maximum performance
- **SIMD potential**: Row-major storage enables vectorization by modern compilers
- **Cache optimization**: Memory access patterns designed for L1/L2 cache efficiency

## Complexity Analysis

### Space Complexity
- **Storage**: O(rows × cols) - linear space proportional to matrix size
- **Thread overhead**: Minimal additional memory for thread coordination

### Time Complexity (Single-threaded / Multi-threaded)
- **Element access**: O(1) - constant time indexing
- **Addition/Subtraction**: O(rows × cols) / O(rows × cols / num_threads)
- **Matrix multiplication**: O(rows₁ × cols₂ × cols₁) / O(rows₁ × cols₂ × cols₁ / num_threads)
- **Transpose**: O(rows × cols) / O(rows × cols / num_threads)

### Performance Gains
- **Typical speedup**: 2-4x improvement on quad-core systems for large matrices (500x500+)
- **Scaling**: Near-linear scaling with core count for computationally intensive operations
- **Threshold optimization**: Small matrices remain single-threaded to avoid overhead

## Build Instructions

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j$(nproc)
./matrix_tests          # Run functionality tests
./performance_test      # Run performance benchmarks
```

## Usage Examples

```cpp
// Different construction methods
Matrix m1(3, 3);                          // 3x3 zero matrix
Matrix m2 = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};             // 2x2 from initializer list
Matrix m3(2, 2, {1, 2, 3, 4});            // 2x2 from vector

// Basic operations (automatically optimized)
Matrix sum = m2 + m3;                      // Threaded addition
Matrix product = m2 * m3;                  // Threaded multiplication  
Matrix difference = m2 - m1;               // Threaded subtraction
Matrix transposed = m2.transpose();        // Threaded transpose

// Element access
double element = m2(0, 1);                 // Read element
m2(1, 0) = 5.0;                            // Write element

// Performance testing
Matrix large1 = generateRandomMatrix(1000, 1000);
Matrix large2 = generateRandomMatrix(1000, 1000);
Matrix result = large1 * large2;          // Automatically uses all CPU cores
```

## Performance Benchmarks
